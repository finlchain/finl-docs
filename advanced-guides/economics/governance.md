## DGOS

The DGOS Foundation is FINL's decentralized consensus organization, which establishes and implements FINL's monetary policy, and manages the amount of currency issued each year.

The DGOS Foundation can implement various policies to vitalize the FINL's ecosystem.

## Currency and Issuance

### Unit of Currency

The platform coin, FIN, consists of 9 decimal places. For each three decimal places, the name of each unit is zoned, redo.

|    Unit |             FIN |
| ------: | --------------: |
| 1 kitty |       0.001 FIN |
| 1 goofy |    0.000001 FIN |
| 1 micky | 0.000000001 FIN |

### Currency Issuance

The basic supply for each year is 60 million, and based on the inflation standard supply of 600 million for each group by year.

Inflation is generated by applying an inflation weight to the authority for issuance by year and group is It is at the DGOS foundation.

#### Weighted filter formula

$$
Z_k = A * exp(-B *i) + C
$$

The basic inflation rate (IR) for each number of nodes is 8%, and the inflation weight for each node ($$Z_k$$ ) is applied to A 86.43% to 167.19% inflation weight ($$N_k$$ ) is given. Accordingly, from node 1 to node 70, It has an initial inflation rate of 6.91% (8% \* 86.43%) and 13.38% from the 911 node to the 980 node. It has an initial inflation rate of (8% \* 167.19%).

#### Inflation rate by number of nodes ($$N_k$$)

$$IR=8%$$

$$Z_k = A * exp (-B * i ) + C;$$$$where\, A = 138.06306475, B = 0.06764022, C = 29.12741104, 1 \leqq k \leqq 14, and\, 13 \geqq i \geqq 0$$

|                      k |          n (number of nodes)          |                      i |
| ---------------------: | :-----------------------------------: | ---------------------: |
| $$1 \leqq k \leqq 14$$ | $$(70*(k-1))+1 \leqq n \leqq (70*k)$$ | $$13 \geqq i \geqq 0$$ |

The annual inflation weight ($$Z_y$$) is 90%, and in the first year, the initial inflation rate by number of nodes ($$IR_{y=1}$$) of 100% ($$Z_{y=1}$$) is supplied as inflation. Thereafter, the inflation rate decreases by 90% each year. i.e. 1 year. Primary inflation rate ($$IR_{y=1}$$) is 100% of the initial inflation rate for each group, the second year inflation rate ($$IR_{y=2}$$) is the group 90% of initial inflation rate (100%\*90%), third year inflation rate ($$IR_{y=3}$$) is the initial inflation by group. Decrease to 81% of the rate (100%\*90%\*90%) and the 12-year inflation rate ($$IR_{y=12}$$) is the initial inflation by group reduced to 28% of the rate.

#### Yearly Inflation Rate ($$IR_y$$)

$$
Z_{y=1} = 100\%\; and\; Z_{y\geqq2} = Z_{y-1}*90\%
$$

$$
IR_y = Z_{y=1} * N_k; where\, y= 1,\; \newline IR_y = Z_y * N_k; where\, y \geqq 2
$$

Accordingly, the total supply by Year 12 fluctuates from approximately 1 billion to 1.27 billion depending on the number of nodes.
